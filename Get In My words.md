# Git in my Own Words

## What is Git
From what I understand, Git is a tool that helps me save and track changes to my projects. It’s kind of like a history book for my files — every time I make an update, I can save it with a message and go back if I mess something up. Git makes it easier to work on code without losing progress.  

I’m still learning, but I think Git is really helpful for keeping things organized, especially when you’re working with other people on the same project.

## What I am Curious About
I’m still a little confused about how Git actually keeps track of the changes and what happens when two people edit the same file. I also want to learn more about branches — when to make them, how to switch between them, and how to fix problems if something goes wrong when merging.  

It also seems like there are a lot of commands to remember, so I want to get more comfortable using them step by step.
